#  Indy Colts Add Another Roulette Wheel To Their Offense 

After a dismal season in which they missed the playoffs for the first time since 2011, the Indianapolis Colts decided to shake things up this offseason. In came new head coach Frank Reich and new offensive coordinator Nick Sirianni, both of whom are disciples of Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson.

One of the things that made the Eagles so successful last year was their creative use of personnel and formations, something Reich is looking to bring to Indy. To that end, the Colts signed veteran receivers Ryan Grant and Kamar Aiken in free agency, and then used their second-round pick on Alabama tight end Hale Houser.

All three players are versatile enough to play multiple positions, which should give Reich and Sirianni plenty of options when it comes to designing plays. One wrinkle they may be looking to add is a roulette wheel formation.

The roulette wheel (or triple-option) formation has been around for years but has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years thanks in part to Pederson and the Eagles. The basic idea is to have three players (usually receivers) lined up wide with another player (usually a running back) just behind them. The quarterback can then choose to hand the ball off to the running back, throw it to one of the receivers, or keep it himself.

This formation can be tricky for defenses to defend because they have to cover all three receivers while also accounting for the possibility of a run. It can also create mismatches against linebackers or safeties who may not be able to cover large receivers or tight ends out wide.

The Colts didn't use this formation much last year, but with Reich and Sirianni calling the shots they could start using it more often this season. Grant, Aiken, and Houser are all capable of making plays in this formation, so don't be surprised if you see it pop up from time to time this season.

#  Steelers Wheel Adds Another Dimension To Their Attack 

The Pittsburgh Steelers have been one of the NFL’s most successful teams over the past few decades, thanks in part to their high-powered offense. This season, they’ve added a new weapon to their arsenal: the “Steelers Wheel”.

The Steelers Wheel is a play that takes advantage of QB Ben Roethlisberger’s strong arm and his receivers’ speed. The play begins with a quick snap and a short pass to RB Le'Veon Bell, who then turns around and pitches the ball to WR Antonio Brown. Brown then sprints down the field, while Roethlisberger fades back and looks for an open receiver.

This play can be difficult to defend because it attacks the defense from multiple directions. The short pass to Bell keeps the defense honest, while the long pass to Brown can potentially break a big play. And if the defense concentrates too much on either element of the play, they can be burned by the other.

The Steelers Wheel has already been successful this season; in Week 4, they used it to score a touchdown against the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens had no answer for it, and Roethlisberger was able to complete a 58-yard pass to Brown for the touchdown.

With the Steelers Wheel in their playbook, opposing defenses will have to worry about two dangerous plays instead of just one. This could be the difference maker as Pittsburgh tries to make another run at the Super Bowl

#  What A Difference A Roulette Wheel Makes: Vikings Edition 

In the never-ending quest for the best NFL team, some players and fans alike tend to forget that luck is a huge part of the game. 

 Case in point: the Minnesota Vikings. early last season, they were cruising along with an 8-2 record, looking like they’d be playing in January. But then something weird happened: they started losing games that they had no business losing. One theory is that their good luck ran out, and that a simple change in roulette wheel orientation would have put them back on track. 

For those who aren’t familiar with how NFL odds work: teams are given point spreads based on how likely it is that they will beat their opponent. The bookmakers then make money by taking bets on both sides of the spread. So, for example, if the Vikings are given a 3-point spread against the Packers, this means that the bookmakers think there’s a 3% chance that the Packers will win. 

Obviously, there are innumerable factors that go into any game - injuries, weather conditions, etc. - so it would be foolish to put too much weight into one specific statistic. However, if we take a look at some of the games from last season in which the Vikings lost despite being favored by the bookmakers, there’s a good chance that their bad luck was caused by an unlucky roll of the roulette wheel: 

In Week 15, they were favored by 3 points over the Bengals but lost 16-34; in Week 16 they were favored by 7 points over the Bears but lost 20-23; in Week 17 they were favored by 14 points over the Bears but lost 6-16. If we combine these three games, we see that the Vikings were actually given a total of 24 points by the bookmakers, yet they still lost by a combined score of 30-53. This means that their bad luck cost them almost half a game against their opponents - hardly insignificant when you’re trying to make it to (and win) the Super Bowl. 

Of course, there’s no way to know for sure whether or not changing their roulette wheel would have made all the difference for them, but it’s definitely worth considering as one possible factor in their disappointing 2017 season.

#  Buffalo Bills Start New Season With A Spin Of The Roulette Wheel 

The Buffalo Bills had a productive offseason. They managed to sign some key players and kept their own players from leaving in free agency. Most importantly, they now have a new starting quarterback, AJ McCarron.

The biggest question mark for the Bills this season is how well their new starting quarterback will perform. McCarron has been in the NFL for four seasons, but he has only started three games. In those games, he has completed 66% of his passes for 654 yards, with five touchdowns and two interceptions.

It is important that the Bills manage to win some games early in the season, as they have a very difficult schedule later on in the year. Between Weeks 7 and 16, they will play eight games against teams that made the playoffs last season.

One way that they could improve their chances of winning these games is by relying on their running game. Last season, LeSean McCoy was the team's leading rusher with 1,138 yards. He also scored nine touchdowns on the ground.

If McCoy can continue to be successful running the ball, it will take some of the pressure off of McCarron and allow him to make more plays downfield. The Bills will need all of the help they can get if they want to make the playoffs this season.

#  Chicago Bears Add Second Roulette Wheel In Two Years

In an offseason that has already seen the Chicago Bears make some big moves, they have now announced the signing of free agent roulette wheel. Roulette wheel is coming off his best season as a pro, and the Bears are hoping he can help turn things around in Chicago.

This is the second time in two years that the Bears have added a roulette wheel to their team. In 2017, they signed roulette wheel as a free agent and he ended up playing a big role in their turnaround season.

Roulette wheel has been one of the most consistent players in the NFL over the past few years. He has never missed a game, and he has always been one of the top players on his team.

The Bears are hoping that he can bring some of that same magic to Chicago this year. They had a disappointing season last year, and they are looking to turn things around in 2019.

Adding roulette wheel is a sign that they are serious about winning now. He is a proven winner, and he will be a key player on this team moving forward.

Chicago has already made some big moves this offseason, and adding roulette wheel just adds to that list. They are doing everything they can to improve their team, and they are hopeful that this will be the year that they make a run at the Super Bowl.
