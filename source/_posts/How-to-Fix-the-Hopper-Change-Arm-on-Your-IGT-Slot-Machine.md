The hopper change arm on an IGT slot machine allows you to change the coins in the hopper. When this part breaks, you won't be able to change the coins in the machine. You will need to replace the hopper change arm to fix this issue.

To replace the hopper change arm on your IGT slot machine, you will need a screwdriver and a wrench.

First, use the screwdriver to remove the screws that hold the hopper change arm in place. There are usually four screws that need to be removed.

#  How to Troubleshoot the IGT Slot Machine Change Arm

The IGT Slot Machine Change Arm is a component found in many of IGT's newer slot machines. This component is used to change the denomination of the machine. If this component fails, the machine will not operate, preventing players from playing the machine.

To troubleshoot this component, you will need to access the changer motor. The changer motor is located on the side of the machine near the change arm itself. Once you have access to the motor, it can be tested by applying voltage to it. If the motor does not run, then it will need to be replaced.

If the changer motor is running, then there may be a problem with the change arm itself. To test this, you can manually move the change arm and see if it moves smoothly. If it does not move smoothly, then it will need to be replaced.

If all of these components are operating correctly, then there may be a problem with the logic board or power supply in the machine. These components should be checked by a qualified technician.
