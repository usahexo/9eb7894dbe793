#  Tax authorities to increase scrutiny of gambling profits

International tax authorities are increasing their scrutiny of gambling profits, as they become an increasingly important source of revenue.

In a bid to increase its tax take, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is specifically targeting gambling profits this year. It will be closely examining how much money people make from gambling and whether they have paid the correct amount of tax on it.

The ATO has already identified some high-profile cases involving professional gamblers who haven’t paid the appropriate amount of tax on their winnings. In one case, a professional gambler avoided paying more than $1 million in taxes.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is also taking a closer look at gambling profits. Last year, it launched an audit project aimed at identifying taxpayers who have failed to report gambling income or claim related expenses.

Gambling has become an increasingly important source of revenue for governments around the world. In Australia, for example, it accounted for almost $2 billion in revenue in 2016-17 – up from $1.5 billion the previous year.

Governments are keen to ensure that all taxes related to gambling are collected, as this money can be used to fund important public services such as education and health care.

So if you’ve been making money from gambling, it’s important to make sure you’re paying the right amount of tax on it. The ATO and CRA both have online resources that can help you do this.

#  Online gambling firms could face large tax bills

Online gambling operators could be faced with large tax bills as the government looks to increase the amount of tax revenue it raises from the industry.

The Treasury is understood to be looking at a change in the law that would see online gambling firms taxed at a higher rate than those who operate offline.

Currently, online operators are taxed at a rate of 15%, while those who offer gambling services offline are taxed at 20%. The Treasury is said to be considering increasing the rate for online operators to 25%.

A source close to the matter told The Times that the proposed change was part of a wider plan by the government to increase the amount of money it raises from the taxation of gambling.

“The Treasury is looking at this and considering increasing the tax on online gambling, which is currently lower than on land-based casinos,” said the source.

“It is all part of an effort to increase tax revenues from gambling. There is no firm timetable for when any changes might take place but it is being looked at seriously.”

The proposal has been met with criticism by some in the industry, who argue that it could have a negative impact on business and lead to job losses.

However, others believe that it is important that online operators are taxed at a level that reflects the fact that they benefit from a lower overheads and can offer more competitive rates.

“If you are going to have an environment where there is a level playing field then surely tax should be aligned across all sectors, whether that is retail or digital,” said Harry Lang, CEO of GVC Holdings PLC, one of Europe’s largest online gambling firms.

#  Gambling firm’s £1.8bn profit draws HMRC interest

The high-earning gambling industry is under the microscope of HMRC, with the government organisation investigating a recent £1.8bn profit made by one gambling firm.

Gambling firms have been enjoying healthy profits in recent years, but HMRC has now said that it will be looking into how much tax these companies are paying on their winnings. The announcement was made shortly after the biggest gambling company in the UK, Bet365, revealed that its profits had soared to £1.8bn.

A spokesperson for HMRC said: “We are currently reviewing the taxation of gambling businesses and will be looking at how much tax these companies are paying on their profits. Gambling is a legitimate form of entertainment, but it is important that taxes are paid on any winnings. We will be taking action against any business that is not paying its fair share of tax.”

It is not yet clear what form this action will take, but it is likely that HMRC will begin to target gambling firms with closer scrutiny and increased levels of auditing. It is possible that this could lead to higher taxes or even fines for those companies that are found to be avoiding their obligations.

The news will no doubt come as a blow to the gambling industry, which has been enjoying bumper profits in recent years. The amount staked by UK gamblers has risen by 16% in the last two years alone, and now stands at around £24bn a year. This growth shows no sign of slowing down, with more and more people turning to casinos, online betting and lotteries to try and make some extra money.

Gambling firms have been criticised for exploiting vulnerable people and encouraging addiction, but they have so far managed to avoid significant penalties from the government. This could be about to change, however, as HMRC steps up its efforts to get a piece of the action.

#  You could be liable for tax on your gambling profits

If you're a UK taxpayer and you make money from gambling, you could be liable for tax on those profits. HMRC classifies gambling winnings as self-employment income, and as such, they're subject to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions (NICs).

If you're a higher-rate taxpayer, you'll pay 40% Income Tax on your gambling profits, and if you're a additional-rate taxpayer, you'll pay 45%. NICs are payable at 9% of your taxable profits.

So, if you make £1,000 from gambling in a year, you'll owe £400 in Income Tax and £90 in NICs.

There are a few things to note about gambling taxation. First of all, the tax applies only to profits – not to your total gambling income. So, if you lose £1,000 but win £100, you won't have to pay any tax.

Secondly, the tax is based on your individual profits from gambling – it's not shared with your spouse or any other family members. So, even if you joint gamble and share the profits equally, each person is liable for tax on their own share of the winnings.

Thirdly, the rules around gambling taxation are fairly complex so it's important to get professional advice if you think you might be liable.

Finally, there are a few exemptions from the tax rules. Gambling losses can be offset against gambling profits, for example, and some forms of betting – such as horseracing – are exempt from taxation altogether.

#  How to pay tax on your gambling profits

If you're a gambler, it's important to know how to pay tax on your gambling profits. Here's a guide on what you need to know.

The first thing you need to do is figure out how much money you've won and lost from gambling activities. To do this, you'll need to keep track of your net gambling proceeds for the year. Your net gambling proceeds are the amount of money you've won or lost minus the amount of money you've spent on gambling-related expenses.

Once you have this number, it's time to determine how much tax you owe on your gambling profits. The amount of tax you owe will depend on your marginal tax rate. Marginal tax rates vary depending on your income level and filing status.

For most taxpayers, the gambling income will be taxed at their regular income tax rate. However, there are a few exceptions. If you're a professional gambler, your gambling income will likely be taxed at a higher rate. And if you win a large sum of money from gambling, you may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT).

If you have to pay taxes on your gambling profits, there are a few ways to do it. You can either report your net gambling proceeds as taxable income on line 21 of your Form 1040, or you can claim them as a loss on Schedule A. Whichever option you choose, make sure to keep track of any related documentation (e.g., receipts for bets or wagers, casino couponing books, etc.).

Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time, but it's important to remember that it's also a form of entertainment that comes with its own set of taxes. By understanding how to pay tax on your gambling profits, you can avoid any surprises come Tax Day.
