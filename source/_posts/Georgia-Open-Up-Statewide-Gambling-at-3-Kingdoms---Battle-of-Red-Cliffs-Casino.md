#  Georgia Open Up Statewide Gambling at 3 Kingdoms - Battle of Red Cliffs Casino

The Red Cliffs Casino is gearing up for a big opening weekend as the first of many new casinos to open in the state of Georgia. With gambling now legal statewide, the casino is expecting a large turnout of players eager to try their luck.

The casino is located in the small town of Red Cliffs, just outside of Atlanta. The town was chosen for its strategic location, as it sits just off of the highway and is close to the airport.

The casino features a variety of games, including slots, blackjack, and poker. There is also a buffet and a hotel on site.

The casino has been in development for two years and has cost $100 million to build. It is one of four casinos that are set to open in Georgia in the next few months.

The other casinos are located in Macon, Columbus, and Savannah. All four casinos are owned by Native American tribes.

Georgia has long been one of the few states without any form of legalized gambling. That changed last year when lawmakers passed a bill allowing casinos to be built state-wide.

Supporters of gambling say that it will bring much-needed jobs and revenue to the state. Opponents argue that it will lead to addiction and social problems.

So far, there has been little opposition to the new casinos in Georgia. Many people are excited about the prospect of being able to gamble legally in their own state.

The opening of Red Cliffs Casino is sure to be a major event in Georgia gaming history. Players from all over the state are sure to flock to this exciting new destination.
