#  Gambling Losses in NJ Could be up to $10,000 Per Year 
Residents of New Jersey could be losing as much as $10,000 on gambling every year, according to a new study. The research, conducted by the University of Massachusetts Lowell, suggests that people in the state are spending more money on casino games and other forms of gambling than is being reported.

The study used survey data from 2,000 adults in New Jersey to estimate how much money is being lost on gambling each year. It found that the average resident spends $151 per month on gambling, for a total of $1,812 per year. However, this figure underestimates the real amount spent, as it only includes people who admit to gambling.

When factoring in people who don’t admit to gambling, the total amount spent is likely much higher. The study estimates that these “undetected” gamblers account for 45% of all gambling losses in NJ, which would bring the total amount lost each year up to $10,000.

This news may come as a surprise to some residents of New Jersey, as it’s often thought that most gambling takes place out-of-state. However, the study found that most losses occur within the state’s borders. In fact, only 5% of total losses are attributed to casinos in other states.

So why are NJ residents losing so much money on gambling? There are many reasons, but one of the biggest factors is the availability of casino games and other forms of betting. There are currently 12 casinos in New Jersey, and more are planned for the future. This proliferation of gaming venues has made it easier for people to gamble, and has led to increased losses overall.

Another reason for increased losses is that New Jersey has lowered its tax rates on casino games in recent years. This has made them more attractive to players, resulting in increased competition and bigger winnings for casinos. However, it has also resulted in bigger losses for players themselves.

Ultimately, if you live in New Jersey then there’s a good chance you’re losing money on gambling each year. Of course not everyone loses money – some people win big – but on average residents are spending a lot more than they realize on casino games and other forms of betting. So if you want to avoid becoming part of this statistic then it’s important to be aware of how much you’re spending and what games offer the best chance of winning.

#  You Could Claim Up to $3,000 in Gambling Losses Each Year 

If you're a United States taxpayer and you've gambled in a given year, you may be able to claim your gambling losses on your tax return. Gambling losses can be used to reduce your taxable income, which may result in a smaller tax bill.

In order to claim gambling losses on your tax return, you'll need to itemize your deductions. This means that you'll need to complete Schedule A and list all of your itemized deductions. Gambling losses will go on Line 28 of this form.

If you have more than $3,000 in gambling losses for the year, you can't simply write off the entire amount. You can only deduct the amount of losses that exceeds your winnings for the year. So if you won $2,000 at the casino but lost $4,000, you can only deduct $2,000 of your losses.

It's important to note that gambling losses are only deductible if they're related to gambling activities. So if you go to the casino and lose money playing blackjack, that loss is deductible. But if you go to the casino and lose money playing poker, that loss isn't deductible. This is because poker is considered a game of skill, while blackjack is considered a game of chance.

Gambling losses can also be deducted from other types of income, such as wages or self-employment income. So if you had $5,000 in gambling losses and earned $50,000 from working, you could deduct $5,000 of those losses from your taxable income. This would bring your taxable income down to $45,000 and may result in a smaller tax bill.

It's important to keep track of your winnings and losses throughout the year so that you can accurately report them on your tax return. You should also keep any documentation related to your gambling activity, such as receipts or records of bets placed. This information can help support your deduction if the IRS ever questions it.

#  New Jersey residents could claim up to $1,500 in gambling losses per year 

Residents of the U.S. state of New Jersey may be able to claim a deduction for gambling losses on their state income tax returns, under a new bill proposed in the state legislature.

The bill, which was introduced by state Assemblyman Ralph Caputo on March 21, 2018, would allow New Jersey taxpayers to deduct up to $1,500 in gambling losses per year from their taxable income. The bill has been referred to the Assembly Budget Committee for further consideration.

Under current law, New Jersey taxpayers are not allowed to deduct any gambling losses from their taxable income.

Supporters of the bill argue that it would help to level the playing field between taxpayers who gamble and those who don't gamble. They also argue that it would help to generate additional revenue for the state by encouraging people to gamble in New Jersey rather than in other states.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased addiction and problem gambling, and that it would be difficult to enforce.

#  How Much Can You Claim in Gambling Losses for New Jersey? 

When it comes to gambling, people often think that they can just claim losses and not have to pay taxes on their winnings. This is not the case, as you are still required to report your income and losses from gambling. However, there are some things that you can do in order to lessen the amount of tax you have to pay on your winnings. 

In New Jersey, you are allowed to claim up to $5,000 in gambling losses per year. This is a great way to help offset any taxes you may owe on your winnings. However, if you exceed this limit, you will be required to pay taxes on the amount that exceeds $5,000. 

It is important to remember that if you are claiming gambling losses as a deduction on your taxes, you must also have documentation proving those losses. This could include things like receipts, tickets, or other forms of proof that you actually lost money while gambling. If you do not have any proof of your losses, the IRS may disallow your deduction. 

Overall, claiming gambling losses can be a great way to reduce the amount of tax you owe on your winnings. Just make sure that you keep track of all of your gambling activity and have proof of your losses so that you can avoid any issues with the IRS.

#  NJ Residents Can Claim Up to $5,000 In Gambling Losses

Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey has announced that NJ residents can now claim gambling losses of up to $5,000 on their state income taxes. The change was made in an effort to help promote tourism in Atlantic City and other parts of the state.

"This is great news for New Jersey taxpayers and our economy," said Murphy. "By making it easier for people to deduct their gambling losses, we are encouraging more people to visit our casinos and other attractions, and supporting the thousands of jobs that rely on the casino industry."

 Murphy also noted that the change would make New Jersey's tax laws more competitive with neighboring states like Delaware and Pennsylvania. In addition to casinos, those states also offer a wide range of legal gambling options including lotteries, horse racing, and poker.

The new deduction will be available when filing taxes for the 2018 tax year. Eligible claimants can deduct up to $500 per quarter, for a maximum deduction of $2,000 per year. Gambling losses in excess of $2,000 can still be deducted as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A.
