#  What are the rules of Blood Queen Scratch?

Created by game developer 'Lightricks', Blood Queen Scratch is an online scratch card game that can be played free or for real money.

Like all scratch games, the goal is to match 3 symbols to win. In Blood Queen Scratch, the symbols are different coloured gems - red, green, and blue. The player begins with 10 credits and can choose to scratch one square at a time or all three squares at once. If a symbol is revealed, it is automatically replaced with another symbol.

The game continues until either the player matches 3 symbols or all squares have been scratched. Winnings are calculated based on the bet amount and the player's bet multiplier. For example, if the bet multiplier is x5 and the player wins with two matching symbols, they will receive 25 credits (5x5).

3) Winnings are paid out according to the bet multiplier and the winning symbols.
