#  Paris Saint-Germain Wins Sixth Ligue 1 Title in Seven Years

Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has won the French Ligue 1 championship, their sixth title in seven years. With one game remaining in the season, PSG is six points ahead of second-place Lille OSC.

The club’s latest title was confirmed with a 3-1 victory over AS Monaco on Sunday. Kylian Mbappé, Neymar Jr., and Edinson Cavani all scored for PSG, while Monaco’s only goal came from Gil Vicente Ferreira.

Despite the impressive trophy haul in recent years, PSG have come up short in Europe, where they were knocked out of the Champions League by Manchester United in March. The French side also lost to United in last year’s UEFA Europa League round of 16.

In contrast, domestic success has continued to come PSG’s way, with the club winning four consecutive Ligue 1 titles between 2013 and 2016. Neymar Jr., who signed for PSG from Barcelona for a world-record fee of €222 million in 2017, has been a key player in the club’s recent successes.

The Brazilian superstar is currently the joint top scorer in Ligue 1 this season, alongside teammate Cavani, with 19 goals each.

#  Neymar Scores as PSG Beats Monaco to Keep Ligue 1 Lead

Neymar Jr. netted his league-leading 19th goal of the season on Sunday as Paris Saint-Germain comfortably defeated Monaco 3-1 to maintain their lead atop Ligue 1.

Monaco, who are coached by Leonardo Jardim - the man who led AS Monaco to their first league title in 17 years in 2017, had started the game well and took a shock early lead through Fabinho. The Brazilian midfielder latched onto a ball over the top from Radamel Falcao before poking home beyond Alphonse Areola in the PSG goal.

The home side were level just before the half-hour mark, as Neymar met a Cavani cross with a diving header into the bottom corner of the net.

It was all PSG in the second period, and they soon took the lead; Kylian Mbappé finishing off a fine team move by slotting past Subašić after being played through by Neymar. The resulting victory saw Unai Emery's side open up an 11-point gap at the top of Ligue 1, although second-placed Marseille do have a game in hand.

Speaking after the game, Neymar told French broadcaster Telefoot: "We're very happy with this victory – it was important to win today and take another step towards our objective [of winning Ligue 1]."

#  Kylian Mbappe Brace as PSG Thrash Marseille in French League Clash

Paris Saint Germain registered an emphatic 5-0 victory over Olympique Marseille in their last Ligue 1 game of the season at Parc des Princes. Neymar and Kylian Mbappe both scored twice with Edinson Cavani also on target to make sure of the three points for the home side.

Mbappe opened the scoring for PSG after just eight minutes when he was picked out by Neymar and finished clinically from close range. Neymar then made it 2-0 shortly before halftime, turning in a Dani Alves cross from six yards out.

The Brazilian completed his brace seven minutes into the second half, firing low past Steve Mandanda after being set up by Cavani. Mbappe then got his second of the night in the 71st minute, slotting home after being put through by Julian Draxler. Cavani then added a fifth in injury time to seal a comprehensive win for Unai Emery’s side.

 PSG’s convincing victory means they finish the season with 91 points, four ahead of second-placed Monaco. It was also their 14th league win in a row, equalling another club record. Marseille meanwhile have limped to a disappointing 8th place, some way off their target of Champions League qualification.

#  Cavani Net as PSG Edge Out Lyon to Maintain Winning Run

Edinson Cavani netted his league-leading 16th goal of the season on Sunday evening as Paris Saint-Germain edged out Lyon 2-1 at the Parc des Princes to maintain their unbeaten start to the 2018-19 Ligue 1 Conforama campaign.

The Uruguayan international’s 59th minute strike from the edge of the area effectively putting the result beyond doubt after Kylian Mbappé had given Les Parisiens a first-half lead, before Nabil Fekir’s stoppage time consolation for Les Gones.

With Neymar missing through injury, it was down to Cavani and Mbappé to lead the line for Les Parisiens and it was the latter who made most of his chance in the opening 45 minutes. After being found by Giovani Lo Celso in the box, he took a touch before firing low past Anthony Lopes into the bottom corner.

Lyon posed more of a threat in the second half with Memphis Depay going close and Mariano Diaz seeing a header well saved by Alphonse Areola, but Cavani’s goal ensured that PSG kept up their 100% start to the season ahead of next weekend’s trip to Strasbourg.

#  unbeaten in their last six games

Arsenal have gone unbeaten in their last six games and they will be looking to make it seven against Southampton on Sunday. The Gunners come into the game in good form, having won four of their last six games in all competitions.

Southampton, meanwhile, will be looking to build on their 1-0 win over Watford last weekend. The Saints haven't had the best of seasons, but they will be looking to finish the season strong.

Arsenal come into this game as favourites, but Southampton have been known to cause upset against the top teams. The last time these two sides met, Southampton won 3-2 at the Emirates Stadium.

With both sides in good form, this should be a good game to watch.
