#  Why are these restaurants chosen for Incheon 2022? 

When the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that Seoul would host the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, they also named three cities in South Korea as possible candidates to host the subsequent 2022 Winter Olympic Games. These cities were Busan, Pyeongchang, and Incheon. Incheon was ultimately chosen as the host city on July 31, 2013.

What makes Incheon a good choice for the 2022 Winter Olympics? There are several reasons:

1) The city is centrally located in South Korea and has excellent transportation infrastructure. This makes it easy for people from all over the country to travel to Incheon.

2) The city has a lot of experience hosting major events, including the 2002 FIFA World Cup and the 2014 Asian Games. This means that Incheon is well-equipped to handle large-scale events like the Olympics.

3) The city is planning to use two new stadiums for the Olympics – a new stadium for winter sports and a new stadium for football (soccer). These stadiums will be used after the Olympics and will contribute to Incheon’s goal of becoming a world-class sports city.

4) Incheon is committed to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly Olympics. For example, they plan to use renewable energy sources and recycle or compost waste materials.

5) Incheon has already started preparations for the Olympics, including construction of the necessary infrastructure and renovation of existing facilities. This means that most of the work will be done by the time the games begin in 2022.

The people of Incheon are excited about hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics and are working hard to make sure that they are a successful games. We hope that all visitors will enjoy their time in this wonderful city!

#  What is the criteria for choosing restaurants? 

When traveling, there is always the question of where to eat. What are the best restaurants in the city? The options are endless, and it can be hard to make a decision without recommendations from friends or family. But what if you're looking for something specific? What if you don't want Indian food, or you only have a short time to eat?

There are a few different things to take into account when choosing a restaurant: 

-Cuisine: This is probably the most important factor when choosing a restaurant. Do you want Italian food? Thai food? Sushi? There are so many different types of cuisine out there, it's important to know what you're in the mood for. 

-Location: Is there a specific part of town you want to stay in? Or do you want to be close to the tourist attractions? Restaurants in central locations can be more expensive, but they're often worth it for the experience. 

-Price: How much are you willing to spend on dinner? There's no need to break the bank every night, but remember that cheap eats might not be as good as more expensive restaurants. 

-Time of day: Are you looking for breakfast, lunch, or dinner? Breakfast places usually open early, while dinner places usually stay open later. 

-Atmosphere: Do you want a romantic date night spot, or somewhere with family-friendly vibes? Some restaurants are loud and busy, while others are quiet and relaxing. Consider what's important to you before making your decision.
