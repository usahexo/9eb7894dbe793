<p>Newly appointed manager Julian Nagelsmann has overseen a great run of form recently, with a double down and split against two of the top teams in the division.</p>
<p>Hoffenheim took on Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena and played out an excellent 2-2 draw. Nagelsmann will be hoping to mastermind an upset when he takes his side to the home of the champions on Saturday.</p>
<p>The young coach has been praised for his tactical awareness, and he will need to be at his best against Bayern. Hoffenheim sit in a respectable 8th place in the Bundesliga, but they could move up to as high as 5th with a victory over Bayern.</p>
<p>Nagelsmann only took charge of Hoffenheim in February, but he has already made a big impression on the team. He is one of the most promising young managers in Europe, and it will be interesting to see how he develops in the coming years.</p>
<p>In their last game, Hoffenheim faced Borussia Dortmund and produced an impressive 2-1 victory. This was a real statement of intent from Nagelsmann’s side, and they will be looking to cause an upset against Bayern on Saturday.</p>
<h1 id="1899-Hoffenheim-players-strike-gold-with-double-down-and-split"><a href="#1899-Hoffenheim-players-strike-gold-with-double-down-and-split" class="headerlink" title="1899 Hoffenheim players strike gold with double down and split!"></a>1899 Hoffenheim players strike gold with double down and split!</h1><p>A Hoffenheim 1899 football team players has struck Gold this week with a Double Down and Split. The players, who have been performing consistently well all season, managed to bring their game up a notch and clinch two back-to-back victories in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>The first victory came on March 3rd against Werder Bremen when the team successfully defended their home turf and clinched a 2-1 win. Just days later, on March 10th, they repeated their success by beating FC Augsburg 3-0 on the road. This impressive string of victories has brought Hoffenheim to third place in the Bundesliga table, just behind leaders Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig.</p>
<p>So far this season, Hoffenheim 1899 players have scored an impressive 38 goals in 25 matches played. 21 of these goals were scored by the forwards – an average of 0.84 goals per match. Serge Gnabry is currently leading the pack with 9 goals, closely followed by Adam Szalai with 8 goals. While Hoffenheim’s defence could use some improvement, their strong offence has been more than enough to secure them some important wins this season.</p>
<p>Team captain Kevin Vogt was especially pleased with the latest victory against FC Augsburg: “We put in a great performance today – it was important that we got a good result away from home. We set out to score early and get ahead in the game and that’s what we did. I think we can be very happy with how things are going at the moment.”</p>
<p>Hoffenheim 1899 football team is definitely off to a strong start this season and it will be interesting to see how they fare in the coming months. With only a few matches left until the end of the Bundesliga season, they will need to continue playing at their best if they want to qualify for Europe next year.</p>
<h1 id="Double-down-and-split-equals-big-win-for-1899-Hoffenheim"><a href="#Double-down-and-split-equals-big-win-for-1899-Hoffenheim" class="headerlink" title="Double down and split equals big win for 1899 Hoffenheim!"></a>Double down and split equals big win for 1899 Hoffenheim!</h1><p>German Bundesliga side 1899 Hoffenheim pulled off a surprise victory over German giants Bayern Munich in the DFB-Pokal semifinal last night. The match was a tight affair with both sides creating chances, but it was 1899 Hoffenheim who took their chance when it mattered and won 2-1.</p>
<p>The result will no doubt come as a huge shock to many, but it is a just recompense for the hard work that the team has put in this season. 1899 Hoffenheim have had an excellent campaign, and currently sit in 4th place in the Bundesliga table.</p>
<p>Their win over Bayern Munich will no doubt give them even more confidence as they aim to qualify for the Champions League next season. They will now face Eintracht Frankfurt in the final of the DFB-Pokal, and they will be confident of winning that game also.</p>
<p>The victory over Bayern Munich was not without controversy, however, as the goal that gave 1899 Hoffenheim the lead appeared to be offside. The decision was confirmed by VAR, however, and there was no doubt that the goal was good.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich were not at their best last night, but they can have no complaints about the result. They will now focus on their attempt to win a seventh consecutive Bundesliga title, but they will know that they have been beaten by a very good team.</p>
<h1 id="1899-Hoffenheim-cashes-in-with-double-down-and-split"><a href="#1899-Hoffenheim-cashes-in-with-double-down-and-split" class="headerlink" title="1899 Hoffenheim cashes in with double down and split!"></a>1899 Hoffenheim cashes in with double down and split!</h1><p>A atypical Hoffenheim 1899 baseball club season as finishes in eighth place in Bundesliga and 2nd place in 2. Bundesliga with an overall record of 63 wins, 49 losses, and 71 draws.</p>
<p>In the Bundesliga, Hoffenheim 1899 started poorly with only five wins by the winter break. Manager Julian Nagelsmann successfully motivated the team to win 16 out of 18 games in the second half of the season, including a 10-game winning streak, for an eighth-place finish. They also reached the DFB-Pokal Final, losing 3–1 to Eintracht Frankfurt after extra time.</p>
<p>In their second division 2. Bundesliga campaign, Hoffenheim 1899 again finished in second place with an overall record of 21 wins, nine losses and 12 draws. They qualified for the promotion play-offs where they beat 1. FC Köln 6–3 on aggregate to return to the Bundesliga for 2019–20.</p>
<h1 id="Double-down-and-split-pays-off-for-1899-Hoffenheim"><a href="#Double-down-and-split-pays-off-for-1899-Hoffenheim" class="headerlink" title="Double down and split pays off for 1899 Hoffenheim!"></a>Double down and split pays off for 1899 Hoffenheim!</h1><p>A double down and split pays off for 1899 Hoffenheim!</p>
<p>The Bundesliga side pulled off a shock 2-1 victory over reigning champions Bayern Munich on Saturday, with an Andreas Beck header in the first half and a Sandro Wagner penalty in the second sealing all three points at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena.</p>
<p>It was an excellent performance from Julian Nagelsmann’s young side, who have now beaten both of last season’s finalists – RB Leipzig and Bayern – in their opening six matches of this campaign.</p>
<p>“That was a top match from us. We took our chances and played really well against a strong team,” said Beck.</p>
<p>Nagelsmann himself was full of praise for his players, admitting that it was “an incredibly good game from my team. We had more chances, we played better football and deserved to win.”</p>
<p>And the head coach also reserved special mention for Wagner, who took his tally for goals this season to five with his match-winner against Bayern.</p>
<p>“He is in great form at the moment and you can see that he is enjoying himself on the pitch. He has worked hard for his goals and I am very happy for him,” said Nagelsmann.</p>
