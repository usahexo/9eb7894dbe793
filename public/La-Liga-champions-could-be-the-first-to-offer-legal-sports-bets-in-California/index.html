class="headerlink" title="Atlético Madrid set to be one of the first clubs in Spain to offer legal sports bets"></a>Atlético Madrid set to be one of the first clubs in Spain to offer legal sports bets</h1><p>Atlético Madrid are about to become one of the first football clubs in Spain to offer legal sports betting.</p>
<p>According to reports, the La Liga side is close to finalising a deal with an online gaming company that will see them offer betting services on their website.</p>
<p>Fans of Atlético Madrid will be able to bet on matches involving the club, as well as other sporting events.</p>
<p>The news comes as Spanish authorities ramps up efforts to legalise sports betting in the country.</p>
<p>Sports Minister Miguel Cardenal recently said that he expects legislation to be passed before the end of the year that would allow for regulated sports betting.</p>
<p>“We are working on a new gambling law which will authorise online sports betting and poker,” Cardenal said. “This law is very important because it will mean a lot of money for the Treasury.”</p>
<p>Spain has been slow to legalise sports betting, despite it being popular among Spanish fans.</p>
<p>According to figures from Spanish gaming regulators, around €800 million is bet on sport each year in the country, with football accounting for around two-thirds of all bets placed.</p>
<p>However, most of this betting takes place illegally, with only a small percentage taking place through licensed operators.</p>
<p>This is due in part to the fact that there has been no legislation regulating sports betting in Spain since 1995.</p>
<h1 id="Club-Atletico-de-Madrid-looking-to-cash-in-on-new-sports-betting-laws-in-California"><a href="#Club-Atletico-de-Madrid-looking-to-cash-in-on-new-sports-betting-laws-in-California" class="headerlink" title="Club Atlético de Madrid looking to cash in on new sports betting laws in California"></a>Club Atlético de Madrid looking to cash in on new sports betting laws in California</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Club Atlético de Madrid is looking to cash in on the new sports betting laws in California. The team is currently in discussions with a number of potential partners to help them set up a betting operation in the state.</p>
<p>“The new sports betting laws present a great opportunity for Club Atlético de Madrid,” said Carlos Fernández, the club’s commercial director. “We are looking for a partner that can help us take full advantage of this market and provide our fans with an enjoyable betting experience.”</p>
<p>The new laws, which came into effect in January 2019, allow Californians to bet on sports events both online and at physical venues. This has led to a surge in interest in sports betting, with a number of companies setting up operations in the state.</p>
<p>Club Atlético de Madrid is hoping to capitalize on this by partnering with a company that has experience in the space. It is also looking for a partner that can provide access to a wide range of sporting events, including major international contests.</p>
<p>“California is a large and important market, and we believe there is great potential for our betting operation here,” added Fernández. “We are confident that our fans will enjoy being able to place bets on their favorite teams through our official channels.”</p>
<h1 id="When-is-club-atletico-de-madrid-have-legal-sports-bets-becomes-a-hot-topic-among-fans"><a href="#When-is-club-atletico-de-madrid-have-legal-sports-bets-becomes-a-hot-topic-among-fans" class="headerlink" title="When is club atlético de madrid have legal sports bets? becomes a hot topic among fans"></a>When is club atlético de madrid have legal sports bets? becomes a hot topic among fans</h1><p>Club Atlético de Madrid, popularly known as Atlético Madrid, is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain. The club was formed on 26 April 1903, as Athletic Club de Madrid, and played its first official game against Arenas Club de Getxo on 14 May 1903.</p>
<p>Atlético Madrid are one of three clubs who have never been relegated from La Liga, the other two being Real Madrid and Barcelona. In the last decade they have won the UEFA Europa League (2010-11), the UEFA Super Cup (2010), and the Copa del Rey (2013-14). They reached the 2013-14 Champions League final but lost to Real Madrid 1-4 after extra time.</p>
<p>Ever since Spanish law changed in early 2018 to allow sports betting on individual games, there has been much speculation about when Atlético Madrid would offer legal sports bets for their fans. The new law allows for licensed online gambling companies to offer single game bets on football matches taking place in Spain. Previously, only online casinos were allowed to offer bets on sporting events, and those bets were limited to pre-match propositions such as who would win or what the final score would be.</p>
<p>On July 2nd, 2018 it was officially announced that Betfair had become Atlético Madrid’s official global betting partner. This gave rise to speculation that a launch date for Atlético’s own sportsbook was imminent. Some reports even speculated that the website might go live on July 3rd - which happened to be Spain’s national day holiday! However, this turned out not to be case and there was still no word from Atlético about when their sportsbook would go live.</p>
<p>Finally, on September 12th it was announced that Betfair’s Sportsbook would go live later that day - just in time for the kickoff of La Liga season! Fans could now bet not only on who would win or lose games, but also on things such as how many goals would be scored or whether there would be a red card. This represented a major shift from pre-match betting propositions to in-play betting options.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how well Betfair’s Sportsbook does with Atlético Madrid fans. Many Spanish football fans are passionate about their teams and like to gamble on their matches. It will be up to Betfair to provide an enjoyable and user-friendly experience if they want to keep these fans coming back for more action!</p>
