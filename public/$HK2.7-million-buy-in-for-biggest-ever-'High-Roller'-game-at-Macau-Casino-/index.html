<p>The biggest ‘High Roller’ poker game in history is set to take place at The Venetian Macau in late May, with a buy-in of HK$2.7 million (US$350,000).</p>
<p>The tournament, which will have a guaranteed prize pool of HK$10 million (US$1.3 million), isexpected to draw some of the world’s best players, including top professionals and high-rolling amateurs.</p>
<p>“This is going to be the richest and most prestigious poker tournament ever held in Asia,” said Anthony Holden, a British author and expert on the game.<br>Billed as the “Macau Millions”, the event will offer players the chance to compete for a share of one of the biggest prize pools ever seen in regional poker.<br>The current record for a ‘High Roller’ game is HK$1.5 million (US$192,000), set at The Star Sydney casino in Australia in January this year.</p>
<p>While there has been no shortage of big-money tournaments in recent years – including last month’s US$250,000 buy-in PokerStars Caribbean Adventure main event – the Macau Millions is expected to eclipse them all.<br>“This tournament is going to be something very special,” said Andrew Robl, an American professional player who has won more than US$5 million in live tournaments. “The stakes are high and the competition is going to be intense.”<br>The Venetian Macau has quickly become one of the most popular venues for high-stakes poker games in Asia, thanks to its luxurious setting and world-class facilities. In November last year, Phil Ivey became the first player to win more than HK$100 million (US$13 million) playing live poker tournaments when he took down the first edition of The Venetian Macau Poker Tournament.</p>
<h1 id="Casinos-banking-on-big-spenders-for-high-roller-games-during-Chinese-New-Year"><a href="#Casinos-banking-on-big-spenders-for-high-roller-games-during-Chinese-New-Year" class="headerlink" title="Casinos banking on big spenders for high roller games during Chinese New Year"></a>Casinos banking on big spenders for high roller games during Chinese New Year</h1><p>Casinos are expecting a surge in business from Chinese high rollers during the upcoming Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>Macau, the world’s biggest gambling hub, is gearing up for what is traditionally its busiest season as millions of Chinese tourists travel to the special administrative region of China to celebrate the new year.</p>
<p>Part of that influx is expected to come from high rollers who will be seeking out games of chance worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, casinos are banking on a 10 percent increase in revenue during the month-long holiday period that begins on Feb. 8 this year.</p>
<p>That would come on top of an already impressive year-on-year growth rate of more than 20 percent in revenue from high roller gaming during the first 11 months of 2017.</p>
<p>The big spending by high rollers is especially important for casino operators in Macau as overall gambling revenues have been declining in recent years due to a crackdown on corruption by Beijing coupled with a slowdown in China’s economy.</p>
<h1 id="Record-HK-2-7-Million-Buy-In-For-Macau’s-Biggest-‘High-Roller’-Game"><a href="#Record-HK-2-7-Million-Buy-In-For-Macau’s-Biggest-‘High-Roller’-Game" class="headerlink" title="Record HK$2.7 Million Buy-In For Macau’s Biggest ‘High Roller’ Game"></a>Record HK$2.7 Million Buy-In For Macau’s Biggest ‘High Roller’ Game</h1><p>The biggest ‘High Roller’ game in Macau’s history took place on Sunday, October 28th. Players bought in for a total of HK$2.7 million (US$348,000), smashing the previous record of HK$1.5 million.</p>
<p>The game was hosted by casino giant Wynn Resorts at its newly-opened Encore Macau property. It featured six players, each of whom put up HK$450,000 to take part.</p>
<p>According to media reports, the winner was a 62-year-old businessman from the mainland who walked away with HK$1.05 million (US$135,000) after winning a three-way all-in battle against two other Chinese players. runner up took home HK$680,000 (US$87,000).</p>
<p>The big win comes as a boost to the mainland businessman, who had reportedly lost around US$10 million at the casino in recent months.</p>
<p>The massive buy-in for the ‘High Roller’ game reflects the growing trend towards high stakes gambling in Macau. In recent years the enclave has seen increasing numbers of wealthy gamblers from across Asia seeking out opportunities to bet larger and larger sums of money.</p>
<p>This trend is being driven in part by a crackdown on gambling in other parts of the region. For example, authorities in China have been cracking down on illicit casino activity within the mainland, while Singapore has introduced new laws targeting underground gaming operators.</p>
<h1 id="Race-to-1-million-in-Macau-High-Roller-game"><a href="#Race-to-1-million-in-Macau-High-Roller-game" class="headerlink" title="Race to $1 million in Macau High Roller game"></a>Race to $1 million in Macau High Roller game</h1><p>There is a new race to $1 million taking place in Macau. The game is a high roller event that will have its finale at the end of the year. The prize pool started out at $1 million, but it has since doubled in size. This means that there is now a total of $2 million up for grabs.</p>
<p>The race began earlier this month and there are currently four players who remain in the running. These players are Fedor Holz, Justin Bonomo, Nick Petrangelo, and Benjamin Zhang. All of these players are incredibly talented and each of them has a good chance of winning the prize money.</p>
<p>The final table will take place at the end of November and it should be an exciting event to watch. There is no telling who will come out on top, but each of the players is sure to put up a fierce competition.</p>
<h1 id="Over-100-players-expected-in-Macau’s-biggest-ever-‘High-Roller’-game"><a href="#Over-100-players-expected-in-Macau’s-biggest-ever-‘High-Roller’-game" class="headerlink" title="Over 100 players expected in Macau’s biggest ever ‘High Roller’ game"></a>Over 100 players expected in Macau’s biggest ever ‘High Roller’ game</h1><p>Macau is set to host its biggest ever high roller game, with over 100 players expected to battle it out for a share of the $13 million prize pool.</p>
<p>The five-day tournament kicks off on Sunday at the Galaxy Macau resort, and will see some of the world’s top poker players fighting for supremacy. The buy-in for the event is a hefty $25,000, and with so much money on the line, there is sure to be plenty of action.</p>
<p>The current chip leader is Chinese player Bu Huang, who has amassed a stack of 430,000 chips. He will be looking to add to his tally by beating some of the game’s top players, including Daniel Negreanu, Phil Ivey and Erik Seidel.</p>
<p>Negreanu is one of the most experienced players in the field, and he will be looking to add another major title to his impressive resume. The Canadian has already won four World Series of Poker bracelets, as well as a European Poker Tour title. He will be hoping to make it five WSOP bracelets this week in Macau.</p>
<p>Ivey is also one of the most accomplished players in the game, and he will be looking to add another High Roller title to his list of achievements. The American has won 10 World Series of Poker bracelets and more than $23 million in prize money during his career.</p>
<p>Seidel is another player who knows how to win big tournaments, having collected eight WSOP bracelets and more than $19 million in prize money. He will be looking to add another High Roller title to his trophy cabinet this week in Macau.</p>
